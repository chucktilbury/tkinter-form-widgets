Still need complete testing and bug fixes.

*done* Need a way to detect similar records in a generic way. Using the LIKE clause?

If a possible duplicate record is located, then a dialog is presented with the
names, allowing select of one or save as is.

*done* Figure out a way to select an item from the list of duplicates for editing or whatever.
Something similar to the file selection dialog that filters as you type. Instead of
a "select" dialog, implement a "find" dialog.

Maybe right-click on a field brings up a search dialog for that field.
